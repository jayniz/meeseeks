# Meeseeks

## Usage

Asynchronously submit metrics to a Circonus HTTPTrap:

```ruby
> m = Meeseeks::Meeseeks.new(
  data_submission_url: 'https://api.circonus.com/module/httptrap/2ds89as2-29e3-4155-a54a-4b7261419e11/secret',
  interval: 60,
  max_batch_size: 100
)
=> <
>  m.record('group', 'metric', 22.02)
=> true
```

### Meeseeks statistics

Meeseeks will instrument itself on Circonus. Look for these metrics:

- ``meeseeks`batch_size`` (how many measurements were submitted per request to Circonus?)
- ``meeseeks`cycle_count`` (how many intervals did this meeseeks instance do?)
- ``meeseeks`queue_size`` (how many measurements are waiting in the queue to be submitted?)
- ``meeseeks`request_count`` (how many requests to Circonus did this meeseeks instance do?)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `make build` - you need only docker on your machine, no ruby, rvm, or any of that.

### Run the tests

During development, you can just keep `make guard` running and it will test files as you edit them. You can also run `make test` to run all of the tests.

### Automatically fix rubocop offenses

Run `make rubocop`.
